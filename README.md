# Duplicate Word Checker

This Java program allows users to input a series of words and identifies duplicate words within the input.

## Overview

The `test.java` file in this repository contains a simple Java program that checks for duplicate words in a user-inputted string. It uses basic string manipulation and user input handling to accomplish this task.

## Functionality

The program performs the following tasks:
- Accepts a string of words separated by spaces from the user.
- Converts the input string to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
- Splits the input string into individual words.
- Identifies and displays duplicate words found in the input.
- Prompts the user to exit the program or continue entering words.

## Usage

To use this program:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the `test.java` file.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input words and identify duplicates.
4. Type `1` when prompted to exit the program.

## Example

**Input:**

hello world hello test world
**Output:**
Duplicate words:
hello
world
